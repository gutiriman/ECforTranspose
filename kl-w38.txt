■Stripe

 PW:R~+
 CardNum for test:4242-4242-4242-4242

 First of all, payment data includes card info etc. never stored in react or firebase.
 These front-end and back-end only use session-id passed from strip to communicate with stripe.

 In index.js, it is need to wrap with <Elements stripe={stripePromise}> to use stripe.
 (.env file should be created and the key for stripe is written here)

 It seems "line_items" should included in the checkout data for Stripe.
 We also added custom field of "custom_text" for Order_ID to know the customer with given Order_ID has paid.
 ->result with this custom_text also can be confirmed in stripe Payments page after payment.

 After checkout page appears, you can send this page link to your customer.

■Server
#if you have a server in backend, this should be done at begging for firebase CloudFuncitons.
#and in function folder edit index.js for server

 ■Firebase CloudFunctions(backend. In pj folder) *switch to blaze plan)
 $firebase init -> select Function:Configure a Cloud Functions dir~
  ->existing project ->01-react-EC ->JavaScript
  ->Eslint? No -> install dependencies? Yes(firebase.json will be created)

 then, functions folder will be created.Edit you server code here.

 (Initial Setting in functions folder)
 $npm install express stripe cors (this is sample here)
 $npm i -D dotenv nodemon
 change package.json's "start" to nodemon ~

 $npm start

 create .env with stripe api key

  (in index.js)
  ・add head with "const functions = require("firebase-functions");",
  ・add bottom with "exports.app = functions.https.onRequest(app);"
  
 ■Deploy(in functions folder)
 disable app.listen for deploying(to detect if it is running on cloud funtion,
 and swith WEB_APP_URL in .env of functions
 
 $npm run deploy (defined in package.json for deploy functions only)

 (only once)
 In GoogleCloudConsole(Not firebase console), with target function,
 add principals of "allUsers" and assign roles with "Cloud Functions Invoker"

■React use stripe
(Initial Setting)
 npm i @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
 
 create .env with stripe api key

■Firebase Hosting(frontend. In pj folder)
(initial)
$firebase init
 ->hosting(Configure files for Firebase~) ->existing PJ(01-react-EC) ->firebase-recipes ->build
 ->single page?yes ->with github?no

dont forget changing target url of server side(this case .env of functions dir).

(after initial)
$npm run build
$firebase deploy --only hosting

■Domain
<お名前.com>
ID:55527029
PW:r~
 ->"tscore.online"

Add cuctom domain in firebase hosting(this case, without checking redirect ~).
  then, get TXT record and A record and copy it to お名前.com(add to DNS setting of domain).
  then, verify.
 After verify, it would take an hour for https connection.

After adding custom domain add "Authorized domains" of Authentication service in FIrebase.
(otherwise you cant use auth from your website after changing its domain)

■Google Search conosole.

Add property -> Domain(Type tscore.online) -> get TXT info and copy it to new TXT record in お名前.com
and get verified.

Go to URL inspection: https://tscore.online.
 "TEST LIVE URL" make sure "URL is availabe to Google" 
 then, REQUEST INDEXING.
